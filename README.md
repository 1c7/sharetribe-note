### About 1c7 (the guy who wrote this)   

I don't work for Sharetribe, I have a projet(not my idea) that are base on Sharetribe

File beside `readme.md` you don't have to look inside, because these are unfinished note.  
I would put link down below once it finished, so you don't have to worry about it.
